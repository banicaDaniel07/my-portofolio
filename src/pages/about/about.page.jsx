            <Description width >I am an junior front end developer, 24 years old, who lives in Romania, passionate about the work I do and Iâ€™am always dedicated. Started in college with some back end programing languages, like C++, Java and PHP, but fell in love with front end. I like to learn new thinks and with JavaScript or Front end, learning never stops, because thinks change very fast. I am always interested in new technologies and libraries that can be used to improve the current state of the application that's why i choosed React. </Description>
